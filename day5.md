# Day 5

First off, kudos to all of you for coming this far. Though this group took off when we were a lot more clear about the future and just wanted to make use of the time to learn something, we are currently at a time where there is so much uncertainty about what is to happen next or when classes and other things would go back to normal. 

At a time like this, it's easy for our days to skip into a blur, with no commitments or structure. So to everyone who is trying their best to keep up - you have all my love and respect. 

Given that most haven’t been able to chip away on yesterday’s task, you can work on it today. I’ll send our last task tomorrow, the one where we work on our final website, and I’ll be working along with you. 

Before you get there, it’s essential that you build some confidence and comfort in handling HTML & CSS. *So it’s crucial that you make an attempt on task 1 & task 2*, if you haven’t already , to  
* Get the thrill of making something base up
* Discover the weak spots in your knowledge
* Learn how to actually solve problems when they come

### "I'm stuck"

*Did you take a small pause on day 1 or day 2 and then realized by the time you got back to the group that everyone had finished so much, that you were severely lagging behind and could never hope to catch up?*

Refer to the different files in [this folder](https://github.com/liyanasahir/mission-buildwebsite) to catch up. 

Take it day by day.

Don’t feel bad about sending submissions late. Your questions for old topics are also welcome in the group!

You might never get a time like this ever again to get started. 

### “I’m done with both tasks!”

Good job!
You can make use of this extra time to learn Javascript. 

Unlike HTML and CSS which are technically scripting and styling languages, Javascript is the actual *programming language used for web development*. 
A brief intro on Javascript: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk

Just quickly watch the video to understand concepts. More important part is to try the hands on tutorial given here: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/introduction-to-javascript/exercises/intro

If you already know some programming language - it would be very easy for you to get started here. Otherwise, it’s still cool. The whole purpose of the tutorials is to build a strong base for everyone, regardless of previous experience.
