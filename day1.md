# Day 1

Hey you!
Today, we’ll be starting off with the basics of HTML. 

## Why HTML?
HTML is the foundation of all web pages. Without HTML, you wouldn’t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web pages!

At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document, structure a document into logical sections, and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 

1. Take some time to slowly go through this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE

Don’t worry about trying out each and every bit of code explained in it. Just watch and make sure you understand what is being done. 

2. Then, head over to this link and try out the mini tasks: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/intro-to-html/exercises/intro

They’ll look too simple when you begin. That’s the point! But make sure you do it all,  because 

 * typing it out is important for it to stay in your memory
 * you’ll be better equipped to deal with unexpected errors in code in the long run

If you're done with the tutorials and have the time, do attempt some of those code given in the video. 

Feel free to send in your questions at any point of time throughout the day :)
