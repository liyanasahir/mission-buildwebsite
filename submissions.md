## What next?

> If you want to go onto build more professional websites, learning a backend and frontend framework is a must. 

The field of web development is vast - there's always something new to learn. Your learning doesn't end here. 

There are mainly two aspects to web development: front-end and back-end. You should [read more](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-front-end-and-back-end-web-development/) about those concepts. 

What we have covered in the past week is the most essential aspect of front-end development. Now, you can 
* learn how to use Bootstrap to build responsive websites, quickly without getting bogged down by too much CSS. [This](https://www.udemy.com/course/bootstrap-4-tutorials/?LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-VVN4hfxoHj4MA.kr2IYnlA) is a good starting point for it.

* learn the basics of javascript we covered on [day 5](https://github.com/liyanasahir/mission-buildwebsite/blob/master/day5.md) (video + tutorial). Read through [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) if you want to brush up your memory. Then quickly learn a framework like React to get industry ready. 

**Tired of designing and want to move onto building a full on web application?** If there's one course anyone interested in web development should take, its [IMAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCJuaI51Oek&list=PLJ6vobRc0TSIZS7r0eKYfJ2HF95NGKY5s) (Introduction to Modern Application Development). It was crafted by alumni and faculty of IIT Madras, and is really comprehensive - you quickly get onto building your apps, complete with database and everything. You can get started on this course with the knowledge you have now. Take a look at the course website(https://www.imad.tech/) to know more, but don't wait till they roll out a new course as you can quickly get started using the youtube links provided. 

If you choose to take any of the above routes, do let me know. Stay in touch! :)
