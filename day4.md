# Day 4 - Task 2

So far we’ve covered how we can use HTML and CSS to build simple websites. 

What actually is the difference between websites and web application? What is actually happening behind the scenes when you request for a website by typing out its URL?

I feel this video explains it the best: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5CQK1knRko

In the task given to you yesterday, you might have noted that most of the content and the basic html and css information is already present. This was given to you so that you could get straight away into the bigger stuff and see how making small changes can cause big differences in results. 

Today, let’s start from scratch. Prepare an html and css template for a website of your own choice. This is to ensure that you get comfortable with the concepts learned, before moving onto adding functionality to your page through actual code: Javascript. 

If you are out of ideas, the website could be for SHE in which case by the end of this program you can submit it for the contest, or it can even be your own personal website. 

Put in sections relevant to you. Use the lorem ipsum generator to put dummy text after giving proper heading for any particular section: https://www.lipsum.com/

You can refer to the templates from yesterday’s task to get started. Keeping a similar layout is also okay for now. But make sure you go beyond it. Things to try out: 
1) Change the color scheme to your own
2) Incorporate a cool font using Google Fonts
3) Create a form where someone can enter their contact details and put it at the end
4) Embed a youtube video

There’s no pressure to have a finished webpage by the end of the day today - just keep tinkering. Refer to w3schools.com to fill in the gaps in your knowledge when you realize there are things you don't know. 

And remember - it's okay if things don't look perfect now, you're only just getting started! http://vimeo.com/24715531
