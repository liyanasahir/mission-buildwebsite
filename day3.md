# Day 3 - Task 1

What we have today is a small task for you to complete by the end of the day: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Structuring_a_page_of_content

In short - A simple html page will be provided to you with some ready made styling as well. Download the existing code and add the additional elements such that the final output begins to look like the one given in the page. 

For those who have followed along with the videos - this would be very simple and you can complete it quickly! You can even make changes to the styling if you feel like it. Make sure that the code is uploaded as mentioned in the page and share it here. 

#### A tip - 
You’ve already covered the concepts required to complete this task in the past two days. But if at any point you’re feeling stuck, you can google it - some of the suggested pages to use as reference are w3schools.com and developer.mozilla.org, so open these links when your google results pop up. If you can’t find a satisfying answer, as always, feel free to share the questions here.

### Are you lagging behind with the past two days tutorials?
No worries - it’s alright, and there is still a lot of time to catch up. Mastering HTML can take a day or two, but it takes a lifetime to master CSS. 

If you have any trouble following along with the videos given (even net issues), you can directly go to the hands-on tutorial links given each day. If there's anything else that's keeping you stuck, feel free to use the feedback form to send it anonymously. 

Today’s task is small, so do make an attempt on it once you’re done with the videos.
